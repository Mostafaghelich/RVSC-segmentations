# RVSC-segmentations
Cardiac MRI images of right ventricle segmentation challenge (RVSC) and corresponding segmentation in ED and ES
A ".mat" file is prepared for each patient which is a structure in MATLAB. It has 6 files containing:


•	Segments_ED_lw: This is a stack of binary images which represents the result of segmentation by our proposed method in End Diastole phase of cardiac cycle.

•	Segments_ED_man: This is a stack of binary images which represents the result of manual segmentation in End Diastole phase of cardiac cycle.

•	Segments_ES_lw: This is a stack of binary images which represents the result of segmentation by our proposed method in End Systole phase of cardiac cycle.

•	Segments_ES_man: This is a stack of binary images which represents the result of manual segmentation in End Systole phase of cardiac cycle.

•	ED_images: End Diastole images

•	ES_images: End Systole images
